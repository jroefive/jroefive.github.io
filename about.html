title: About Me
---

I've always been a data nerd.  In high school, I went from liking math to loving it when we finally did regression.  In my bachelors degree in math and my masters degree in math eduaction, I was most interested in applied math.  And in my career as a teacher and administrator, I spent my free time trying to find patterns in data.  

I decided to use my quarantine time to teach myself some data science skills so that I can incorporate those skills and tools into my future work.
