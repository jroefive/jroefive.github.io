I've always been a data nerd.  In high school, I went from liking math to loving it when we finally did regression.  In my bachelors degree in math and my masters degree in math eduaction, I was most interested in applied math.  And in my career as a teacher and administrator, I spent my free time trying to find patterns in data.

I decided to use my quarantine time to teach myself some data science skills so that I can incorporate those skills and tools into my future work.  I'll be sharing that work in four categories:

Phish Stats - Phish has played over 1700 concerts and over 800 different songs.  Their setlists change every show and there are tons of hidden patterns and interesting trends that can be uncovered using data tools.  
Musings on Data Science in Secondary Education - As I learn more about data science, I'm thinking a lot about how it can be applied to creating a more empowering environment for young people in schools.
How I'm Learning - I'm trying different approaches to learning data science and I'll share some thoughts on how that's going.
The Rest - Apart from teaching myself, I'm doing a lot of other things in quarantine and I'll share random thoughts about that here.
