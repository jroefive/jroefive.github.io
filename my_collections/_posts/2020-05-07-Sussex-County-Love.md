The last time I lived in Sussex County was 2001, the year I graduated high school.  In the two decades since, I've always enjoyed my visits back to the area I grew up in.  And, I've always felt that it was a great place to grow up in, but not somewhere I'd want to live again.  The virus has changed that a bit.  And while I wouldn't consider it home again after six weeks of quaratnining with my sister and her family, I am feeling a resurgence in love for my hometown.  This has mainly been facilitated by the long daily walks I've been taking.  Each day I walk for about three hours and listen to podcasts and music.  Over the last six weeks, I've seen so much of the county.  Here'a cool little mapping I made of the walks I've done so far.

Below are some photo highlights from these walks.  If you want to see all the pictures I took, you can find them in my googlt photos album here.
