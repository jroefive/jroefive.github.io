About a month ago, in the process of trying to facilitate some conversation about machine learning in education, I was directed towards a great resource: [https://datascienceineducation.com/}(https://datascienceineducation.com/).  I was excited to find a resource focused dirctly on using data science in the education field.  The first thing I noticed, though, was that this entire book was focused on using R, after I had just spent the last six month teaching myself Python.  Fortunately, the book was set up clearly enough that I could follow along, and even just dump code in when I didn't know what it meant.  And, my knowledge of Python, especially Pandas, made it relatively easy to translate what the code was doing in R to what I thought it would look like in R.

After seeing a handful of jobs list R speciically, and not Python, I thought it would be good to at least get the basics down.  I came across a weekly challenge call #tidytueaday where they give you some data and you make whatever visual you want with it.  I'm enjoying it a lot, I think the coding takes a little longer than I would take in Python, but I think that will change over time.  And, the visuals on R are better.  Here are the first three I've done:

I'm hosting all my code in the Tidy-Tuesday repo found here: [https://github.com/jroefive/Tidy-Tuesdays](https://github.com/jroefive/Tidy-Tuesdays)  

And, posting each week on Twitter @JesseRoe55
