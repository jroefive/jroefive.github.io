I've now listened to about forty episodes of various data science podcasts, including all episodes of Towards Data Science.  I kept a running list of ideas, concepts, and people that I thought I would need to learn about while listening.  I also had a bunch of blog ideas in this file but I have already shared them in the landing pages for each section of the blog.   Here are the notes lists.

### People

### Programs
