Even though I had hopes that the delay in announcing this week's stream meant that we might get a special treat, I was still happy to have this show come up.  I wore a sloth onesie to this show and walked around the concourse pre-show extremely slowly, especially in bottlenecks, just to mess with people.  It was really fun to see annoyed people get past me then look back and chuckle once they realized the bit.  It was also funny to hear people yell "Wombat!" and have the lady in the spicy chicken sandwich line say: "How many sandwiches does the bear want?"

I copied the exact some graphics and scheme from last week's stream so if you want some more in depth descriptions you can look at [last week's post.](https://jroefive.github.io/2020/05/17/Dinner-and-a-Movie-7-21-97.html)

### Song Durations  
* Because there are two song sandwiches (Wolfman's > Party Time > Wolfman's[1] and Tweezer > DDHVL > Tweezer) I had to figure out the best way to show it in the data.  I decided it was best to just list Wolfman's and Tweezer once instead of having essentially the same data shown again in a graph that's already super busy.  Thus the duration of Wolfman's and Tweezer is the combined time of both times they were played during the show.  
* None of the song durations are extreme enough outliers to mention but the 46 Days and Tweezer are in the top 25 percent for length and Carini is a bit short, especially if compared just with the most recent 95 shows.

[1] - Based on Phish.com LivePhish.com this is a separate song, Phish.net and Phish.in have it marked as teases.  I think Party Time is played in full since 100% of lyrics are sung.

### Song Placement  
* For Wolfman's and Tweezer, you'll see two purple Y's because they are both technically played twice.

### Overall Show Length and Tracks  
* I dropped Big Cypress to be able to see the data a bit better.  But you can see [Big Cypress included on this graph](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/2575772/) for context.

### Same Transitions  
I thought it would be cool to look at other times that the same transitions happened.
