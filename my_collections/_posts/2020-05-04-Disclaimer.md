I think it's important to include two disclaimers here.  The first is that I know that I currently know very little about the current status of data science and it's history.  I'm not sharing any of this because I believe I have something special to tell you.  I'm writing to share my thought process and help myself monitor my learning.  I hope to periodically go back to the things I post and find the naive things I wrote and fix them.  I also hope to learn faster by having people point out where I have huge gaps in my understanding or where I could have used different tools.

I also plan to share a bit about my experience as an educator and I'm sure that will include some of my frustrations with how data science is currently being used in education.  Although my experience in different school contexts and with different organizations is part of the formation of my current perspective, I don't mean any of my thoughts to be a criticism of any pervious organizations I've worked with or former colleagues.  In my decade and a half in education, I've only worked with people that I believe are doing their best and have pure intentions.  Any critiques are centered completely on systematic issues in education and not individual people or organizations.
