I'm planning to use a consistent structure for Phish Stat posts.  The main reason is to find the right balance between being comprehensive with shoaring my thought process and making posts predictable so people can read just the parts they are interested in.  I'm stealing the name for this post from these awesome [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRN5nIm8cTs) done by Amar.  I'm only mentioning him here because he's awesome and give him credit for what he posts.  I expect that if you have gotten this deep into internet Phish land, you've already stumbled onto his posts.

All posts will start with a quick summary of the project and a link to "Just the Jams."  This link will allow you to skip right to the graphs and tables that visually show what I worked on.  I know most of you won't be interested in reading through my process so that's there to skip right to the best part of the post.

### Equate My Life with Sand
This section is discussing my thought process as I played in the sandbox with all the data.  I'll talk about what I need to do to clean up the data, some decisions I had to make about how to combine or represent the data, and some limitations on the project.  The section will be broken up into sets with set breaks and an encore, they genereally follow my linear process, but not always.

### Mystified and Mishapen
This is meant to be a short summary of all my steps.  A distilled version of the process described in the first part.

### And You Step to the Line
This section will have all the data representations in it, with links to any documents I used and explanations of any stats concepts that I think could be helpful.
