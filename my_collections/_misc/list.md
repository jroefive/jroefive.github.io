Phish, education, and learning data science aren't the only things I spend my time thinking about.  I use the other fifteen minutes of my quarantine taking long walks or bike rides, spedning time with my nibling, helping my sister out in the garden, reading and teaching myself guitar.  I'll post things that don't fit under the other three categories here.

### Blogs Posted
* [Sussex County Love](https://jroefive.github.io/2020/05/07/Sussex-County-Love.html) - A map of all the walks I've taken since coming back to Sussex county and a bunch of pictures.

### Things to post
* Songs or poems I've written
* Pictures from walks and travel
* Share cool stuff that my friends are doing
* Political Rants
