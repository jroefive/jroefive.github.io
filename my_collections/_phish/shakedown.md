Shakedown is not just a place to see the same song titleds crammed into a popular logo or watch zombies flock to the sound of a hissing tank.  Shakedown is also a parking lot.  And a parking lot isn't just for cars.  A parking lot can be a place to park ideas and questions that come up but arne't a priority in the moment.  Below I'll just dump all the data questions and project Ideas I get along the way.

### Project Ideas

* Predict how many songs are left in the set.
* Song cluster analysis - Which songs are most likely to show up in the same set or show.
* Are there patterns on when a song will turn up during a multi-night run
* Mostly Mike, Prolific Page, Frequently Fish, and Totally Trey shows - Which shows have the greatest percentage of songs sung by each member.
* Redefining Phish eras by significant changes in song lengths, show lengths, song selection, etc
* Tagging specific types of showsf - Seguefests for songs with x number of segues, number of bustouts, number of tracks
* Song length and spread analysis - Do songs tend to get longer or shorter over time, can you predict how long the next song will be based on the length of the previous track? How much is the length of the longest song in a set correlated to the number of tracks in that set?
* Song placement analsysis - songs that are predominantly set closers, mid set, encores, etc.
* Light Color Analysis - Comparing all official youtube releases, or potentially dinner and a movie releases, to look for patterns in light colors.  Like a combination of these two projects: 
* State or venue bias - Are they more likely to play certain songs in certain states or venues?
* Predicting the frequency of a song based on its debut - Is it possible to predict how frequently a new song will be played based on the set placement of the debut, or the length of the debut, or how far into a tour the song is debuted?
* Predicting the distribution of how many times each song will be played in the next 50 shows.

### Projects Almost Done
* Song frequence changes over the course of Phish's career or the history of the specific song.
* How have Halloween albums impacted future setlists - Publish along with similar analysis for album releases

### Projects Posted
* Day of week bias analysis - Are some songs played more frequently on certain days of the week?
