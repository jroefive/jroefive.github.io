I'd like to document my learning process but I don't want to overdue it.  So, I'll park a bunch of ideas for what to write about here and choose what feels most interesting.

### Blogs Posted
* [Share a raw copy of my notes from listening to podcasts and walks and explain](https://jroefive.github.io/2020/05/07/Podcast-Notes.html)
* [Quarantine Walk Mapping](https://jroefive.github.io/2020/05/02/Quarantine-Walk-Mapping.html) - Generate a map of walks from a starting point that cover as much of the surrounding roads and paths while minimizing overlapping on roads and paths you've already been on.  So far I just have an idea for an algorithm, not any model.

### Blog Ideas
* Rough outline of all things I've done to try to teach myself data science
* How listening to every episode of the Towards Data Science podcast built my confidence
* How learning Spanish while traveling primed me for teaching myself coding
* Audience for the blog

### Data Science Project Ideas that Aren't Phish
* Six Degrees of Chris Rock - Why do all pop-psych books use the exact examples?  Network analysis of the index of the top 100 pop-pysch books.
