I'd like to document my learning process but I don't want to overdue it.  So, I'll park a bunch of ideas for what to write about here and choose what feels most interesting.

### Blog Ideas
* Rough outline of all things I've done to try to teach myself data science
* How listening to every episode of the Towards Data Science podcast built my confidence
* How learning Spanish while traveling primed me for teaching myself coding
* Share a raw copy of my notes from listening to podcasts and walks and explain
* Audience for the blog
